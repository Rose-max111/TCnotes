\section{Introduction}

\jinguo{}
\ym{Need to add a brief summary about the state-of-the-art TCs. Following is some basic summaries of references
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Discussed the architecture of future thermodynamic computer and brought up an idea about the understanding of using TC to solve problems~\cite{hylton2021vision}.
    \item TODO: search for gadgets for array multiplier.
\end{enumerate}
}

Improving the energy efficiency of computation is a major challenge in the development of future computing systems.
The thermodynamic computer (TC)~\cite{conte2019thermodynamic, hylton2021vision} is a new type of computer that uses thermodynamics to perform computation.
Instead of performing the computation deterministically, TCs are stochastic and are driven by thermodynamics.
Physical implementations of TCs include DNA machines~\cite{tanaka2005design} and Ising machines~\cite{gu2012encoding, lucas2014ising, mohseni2022ising, fabre2014optical}.
% memristors~\cite{yang2013memristive, wang2017memristors, kumar2017chaotic, wang2018fully}, 

The computational process of TCs utilizes the tendency of a physical system to evolve towards the state with the lowest free energy.
By manipulating the minimum free energy state of the system, the computation can be performed.
The change of free energy minimum state can be achieved by changing the distribution of the particles in the system, such as in the case of DNA machines~\cite{Feynman2018} or lowering the temperature of the system, such as in the case of Ising machines~\cite{boixo2013experimental}.
The former is known as the Brownian machine, which evolves the system toward the direction of the entropy increase, while the latter are energy based, which evolves the system toward the direction of the energy decrease.

Energy based models are probability one of the most powerful models for computation.
The Ising model is not only capable of universal computation~\cite{gu2012encoding}, and it can be used to formulate many NP problems~\cite{lucas2014ising,mohseni2022ising}.

However, they are notoriously hard to thermalize, even with the help of quantum entanglement~\cite{boixo2013experimental, boixo2014evidence, Pichler2018, Ebadi2022, Nguyen2023}.
There is no evidence yet that they can significantly outperform existing algorithms run on classical computers~\cite{}.
Even when the encoded problem is an easy one, it is not guaranteed that the system can thermalize in polynomial time as we will show in the main text.

Intrigued by the question of how to thermalize and lower the energy of an Ising machine, we propose a new type of TC that has a crystalline structure.
The crystalline structure is based on a universal elementary CA, and is translational invariant in all spacial dimensions.
The translational invariance not only makes the crystal easier to be constructed in nature, but also enables the study of the scaling behavior the thermalization process.
In the rest of this paper, we first show that the crystalline structure can be programmed on its surfaces to perform universal computation \Cref{sec:Overview-of-main-results}.
Then we use numerical results in \Cref{sec:numerical-result} to show that if we thermalize the crystal from the so-called ``deterministic direction'', the crystal can thermalize in time almost linear to the size of the crystal, i.e. efficient computation can be performed.

% The way to lower the free energy is inspired by the process of crystalization.
% The material is orderly grown by slowly moving the temperature gradient in-plane~\cite{Zhang2014}.
% Growing a perfect crystal itself is a computation process of copying the information from one surface to another.
%In the DNA based TC, the DNA enzyme is driven by thermodynamics, and the computation is performed by the enzyme as it moves along the DNA strand. It is a Brownian type computational model~\cite{Feynman2018} that driven by the change of entropy.

% TCs are distinguished by their ability to employ the underlying physics of the computing substrate to accomplish a task.
% For example, TCs may employ naturally occurring device-level fluctuations to explore a state space and to stabilize on low-energy representations, which may then be employed in an engineered task.
% TCs are directly connected to real-world potentials, which drive the evolution of their internal organization.
% A user might program constraints that describe an optimization objective over the external potentials and that capture the TC’s natural tendency to maximize entropy production in the environment while minimizing entropy production internally.
% TCs have the potential to be more energy efficient than conventional computers, and they may be able to solve problems that are difficult for conventional computers to solve.
% TCs are still in the early stages of development, but they have the potential to revolutionize computing in the future.

% A thermodynamic computer is a complex system, driven by thermodynamics when exposed to external potentials. Like quantum computers, TCs are distinguished by their ability
% to employ the underlying physics of computing substrate to
% accomplish a task. For example, TCs may employ naturally
% occurring device-level fluctuations to explore a state space
% and to stabilize on low-energy representations, which may
% then be employed in an engineered task~\cite{conte2019thermodynamic}.

% Comparing with all conventional computers fully controlled by humans, the TC, on the other hand, are directly connected to real-world potentials, which drive the
% evolution of its internal organization. As an example of using a TC, a user might program
% constraints that describe an optimization objective
% over the external potentials and that capture the TC’s
% natural tendency to maximize entropy production in the
% environment while minimizing entropy production internally~\cite{conte2019thermodynamic}.

%Quantum annealing outperform classical annealing~\cite{boixo2013experimental, boixo2014evidence}.
%Firstly introduced Rydberg atoms to solve MIS problem with quantum property~\cite{Pichler2018}. Utilized quantum annealing on Rydberg arrays to efficiently solve the combinatorial optimization problem~\cite{Nguyen2023}

%Provided basic knowledge about computational model like DNA Enzyme driven by thermodynamics, raised concepts of reversible computing and gradient power~\cite{Feynman2018}.

%Proved Ising model is capable of universal computation~\cite{gu2012encoding}. Provided Ising formulations of many NP problems~\cite{lucas2014ising}.
%Reviewed various type of Ising machines as hardware analog solvers of combinatorial optimization problems~\cite{mohseni2022ising}.
%A special optical form Ising machine~\cite{fabre2014optical}.
%Other type of TCs like memristors~\cite{yang2013memristive, wang2017memristors, kumar2017chaotic,wang2018fully}, DNA machine~\cite{tanaka2005design}. 




\section{Overview of the computation model}\label{sec:Overview-of-main-results}
The TC we are proposing is shown in \Cref{Surface-programmable-thermodynamic computer}. It features a crystalline structure that encodes the time evolution of a universal CA that capable of performing universal computation.
To encode a $d$-dimensional CA, we need a $d+1$-dimensional crystal. The extra dimension is used to encode the time-axis of the CA.
For simplicity, we will focus on the one dimensional 110 rule elementary CA in the rest of this paper.
The physical implementation of the TC is based on the Ising model, where we use the spin up and down to encode the state $1$ and $0$ of the cellular automata, respectively. The energy of the Ising model is designed to be minimized when the spins are in the state that satisfies the rule 110 cellular automata, which can be achieved by constructing the rule 110 gadget shown in the inset of \Cref{Surface-programmable-thermodynamic computer}.

The inputs, including the data and the program are encoded in the initial configuration of the spins on the left surface. These spins are fixed during the computation.
The entire computing process can be described by gradually moving an external heat bath with finite width from the input end to the output end.
It creates a temperature gradient and, consequently, a heat zone of width $W$. By utilizing thermal fluctuations from the heat bath, the spins in different layers sequentially settle into low-energy states within the state space, effectively completing the iterative computation of the CA.

%Users can design the computing algorithm and obtain the desired output by setting the input configuration and then making slight movements to the external heat bath, requiring only approximately linear time (up to a $\log^2$ factor) with respect to the number of layers.

\section{Model and Method}\label{sec:model-method}

\subsection{Elementary cellular automata}\label{elementary-cellular-automata}
In cellular automata (CA), `space' is a regular lattice of `cells', each of which contains one of a small allowed set of integers.
Only cells that are close together interact in one `time-step'-the time evolution is given by a rule that looks at the contents of a few neighbouring cells, and decides what should change. At each step, this local rule is applied everywhere simultaneously~\cite{}.
Depending on different rules, some CAs can be more complex than others.
The most interesting category is those proved to be universal~\cite{Berlekamp2004}, meaning that they can simulate any computer program. The best-known examples in two-dimensional include Conway's~\cite{Games1970} ``Game of Life'', Margolus's reversible CA~\cite{Margolus1984} and its quantum version~\cite{Arrighi2012}.
The simplest universal CA is a 1-dimensional CA, namely, the rule 110 CA~\cite{Cook2009}.
This CA is an elementary CA that defined on a one dimensional grid, each cell has two possible states (labeled by 0 and 1). The rule of an elementary CA to determine the state of the cell in next generation depends only on the current state of the cell and its two immediate neighbors. The number of possible elementary CA rules is the same as the number of 3-input Boolean functions, which is $2^{2^3} = 256$. The Boolean function for rule 110 is shown in the following table:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Current Pattern & 111 & 110 & 101 & 100 & 011 & 010 & 001 & 000 \\
\hline
New Center Cell & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

The name of the rule comes from the binary representation of the rule number, which is 110 in decimal.
Let us denote the states of the three cells as $p$, $q$, and $r$, from left to right, respectively. The rule 110 can be expressed as the following Boolean function:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:110rule}
    q^\prime = r \land \neg (q \land \neg p)
\end{equation}
where $q^\prime$ is the state of the center cell in the next generation.

\subsection{CA embedded in an Ising model}

An $n$-vertex fully connected spin-glass Hamiltonian is described as follows.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:ising}
E(\vs) = \sum_{i < j} J_{ij}s_us_v + \sum_{i=1}^{n}h_i s_i
\end{equation}

where $h_i$ is onsite energy, $J_{ij}$ is interaction energy and
$s_i \in \{-1, 1\}$ is local spin. $s_i=1$ means spin-up and $s_i=-1$ means spin-down.

Previous studies have shown that the Ising model is universal for computation~\cite{Aadit2022, onizawa2020design, camsari2017stochastic}, meaning that any logic circuit can be encoded into the Ising model and solved by finding the ground state of the Ising model. A universal set logic gate gadgets are designed, by concatenating which any logic circuit can be constructed.
For example the logic expression $z = \neg (a \land b)$ can be encoded into the Ising model by the following Hamiltonian:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        E_{c = a \land b} &= s_a s_b -2 s_a s_c -2 s_bs_c + s_a + s_b -2 s_c\\
        E_{z = \neg c} &= s_c s_z\\
        E_{z = \neg (a \land b)} &= E_{z = \neg c} + E_{c = a \land b}
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
where, the variable $c$ is an ancilla spin.
A CA can be viewed as a translational invariant logic circuit, and thus can be encoded into the Ising model. The ground states of the Ising model encode the correspondence between the inputs and the outputs of the CA.
Directly synthesizing the logic circuit for the universal $110$ rule (\Cref{eq:110rule}) requires at least 3 ancilla spins, which is far from optimal. By converting the gadget finding problem to a linear programming problem~\cite{Kolman1995}, we propose a provable optimal method to encode any CA rule into the Ising model, which is described in \Cref{sec:gadget-design}.
The proposed gadget for the $110$ rule is shown in \Cref{Surface-programmable-thermodynamic computer}, which only requires 1 ancilla spin.
The interaction energy and onsite energy of the rule 110 gadget are given below, where $p, q, r$ and inputs and $q'$ is the output in \Cref{Surface-programmable-thermodynamic computer}, respectively, while spin $A$ is the auxiliary spin.
\begin{equation}
J = \begin{blockarray}{cccccc}
& p & q & r & q^\prime & A\\
\begin{block}{c(ccccc)}
p & ~\cdot~ & ~1~ & ~1~ & ~2~ & ~3~\\
q & \cdot & \cdot & 2 & 2 & 5\\
r & \cdot & \cdot & \cdot & 2 & 5\\
q^\prime & \cdot & \cdot & \cdot & \cdot & 6\\
A & \cdot & \cdot & \cdot & \cdot & \cdot\\
\end{block}
\end{blockarray}
~~, ~~h = \begin{blockarray}{cc}
& \phantom{x} \\
\begin{block}{c(c)}
p & ~1~\\
q & 2\\
r & 2\\
q^\prime & 2\\
A & 5\\
\end{block}
\end{blockarray}
\end{equation}
%Since a copy gate\jinguo{do we really use copy gates?} \ym{No need in practice, but indeed used in Fig.1a} can be simply described as two spins with an interaction $J_{u, v}=1$, and by applying the method of connecting logic gates~\cite{Aadit2022}, we can concatenate the rule 110 gadget with some copy gates, ultimately forming
By concatenating the rule 110 gadgets, we can construct a 2-dimensional TC that implements the rule 110 CA, as shown in \Cref{Surface-programmable-thermodynamic computer}.
The gadget we constructed based on the Rule 110 CA naturally possesses Turing completeness. Therefore, this 2-dimensional TC is capable of universal computing.

To set the inputs, we raise or lower the energy of spins on the left surface. To set a spin to $s_i=-1/1$, we raise/lower the external field $h_i$ by $\Delta_{in}>0$. By setting all the spins on the left surface, the ground state of the TC has no degeneracy, and the output is encoded in the spins on the right surface.
One can also set the outputs by raising or lowering the energy of spins on the right surface. Due to the lack of reversibility, the ground state may still have degeneracy.
Each ground states corresponds to a solution to the encoded circuit satisfaction problem if the target circuit is satisfiable.
We denote the computation from the left to the right as the \emph{deterministic computation}, and the computation from the right to the left as the \emph{non-deterministic computation}.

\subsection{Compute by annealing}\label{simulated-annealing-algorithm}

With the proposed Ising model, we are interested in how efficiently we can drive the system to the ground state, which encodes the output of the CA.
In contrast with a traditional computation model, cooling an energy model does not have a specific direction.
It can be done from the input to the output, from the output to the input or neither.
Intuitively, cooling the deterministic computation is much easier than cooling the non-deterministic computation.
Since the latter encodes the circuit satisfaction problem, which is NP-hard, while the former is a simple linear-time computation.
However, this is not always the case.
Global cooling by gradually lowering the temperature (or annealing), as in the Ising machine~\cite{fabre2014optical}, may still hard for a deterministic computation, no matter how large the input detuning $\Delta_{in}$ is.

%In the following article, denote one sweep as the process of trying to flip each spin at its local temperature.

% \ym{
%     The material was orderly grown by slowly moving the temperature gradient in-plane~\cite{Zhang2014}. Tested thermal gradient force for grain boundary migration~\cite{Bai2015}.
% }
%We test the hypothesis: Cooling is easy if the process is from the
%deterministic direction, hard if the process is from the
%non-deterministic direction.
\begin{hyp}
Let $\mathcal{P}$ be a circuit SAT problem, and $\mathcal{E}$ be an energy modeling encoding of $\mathcal{P}$ (locally). There exists a subset of $\mathcal{E}$ that exhibits the overlap gap property~\cite{Gamarnik2021}.
\end{hyp}
\jinguo{Confirm with Maddie}
The overlap gap property is a property for describing the algorithmic intractability in random structures, which is based on the topological disconnectivity property of the set of pair-wise distances of near optimal solutions.
If the energy landscape of a optimization problem exhibits the overlap gap property, then it can not be solved by any local algorithms in polynomial time, including the simulated annealing method used in this work.
The intuition comes from the energy model encoding of the identity circuit.
Given a circuit with $n$ bits, the ground state degeneracy of the corresponding energy model is at least $2^n$.
The energy model can be vertically stacked $n$ copy gadgets.
Let the circuit depth be $d \sim 2^{\gamma \sqrt{n}}$ for some constant $\gamma > 0$.
The Hamming distance between two degenerate ground states for different input signals is at least $d$, which is exponential to $n$. Let us define the size of the problem as $d\times n$, then this distance is clearly linear to the problem size. We left the rigorous proof of this hypothesis to mathematicians.


\subsubsection{Simulated annealing algorithm}
Since the natural cooling process is highly nontrivial to model, we consider a theoretical model for cooling, which is the simulated annealing (SA)~\cite{Kirkpatrick1983}.
When the energy model in \Cref{eq:ising} thermalizes at temperature $T$, the spin configuration $\vs = (s_1, s_2, \cdots, s_n)$ follows the Boltzmann distribution:
\begin{equation}
    p(\vs) = \frac{1}{Z}\exp\left(- \frac{E({\vs})}{k_bT}\right),
\end{equation}
where $Z = \sum_{\vs} \exp\left(-\frac{E({\vs})}{k_bT}\right)$ is the partition function, 
$E({\vs})$ is the energy of the spin configuration $\vs$, and $k_b$ is the Boltzmann constant, which is set $k_b = 1$ in this work.
%We employ the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm~\cite{metropolis1953equation} to characterize the thermodynamic process of the TC system as modulated by the heat bath.
SA is a Monte Carlo method~\cite{metropolis1953equation} that simulates the thermal annealing process.
It performs a random walk in the state space of the TC, each step we try to flip a spin according to some unbiased prior distribution,
and the probability of accepting a move from state $\vs$ to $\vs^\prime$ is given by:
\begin{equation}
    P_{\vs^\prime\leftarrow \vs} = \frac{1}{1+\exp\left(\frac{E({\vs^\prime}) - E({\vs})}{T}\right)}.
\end{equation}
This accepting probability follows from the Glauber dynamics~\cite{glauber1963time}.
It can be shown that this process is Markovian and ergodic, and the system will eventually reach the thermal equilibrium.
The speed of the convergence is determined by the spectral gap of the transition matrix of the Markov chain, which is defined as
\begin{equation}
    \Delta = 1 - \frac{\lambda_2}{\lambda_1},
\end{equation}
where $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ are the largest and second-largest eigenvalues of the transition matrix, respectively.
In order to sample from the distribution $\epsilon$ close to the equilibrium distribution, the number of steps required is $O(\log_{1-\Delta} \epsilon)$, i.e. the distribution quality improves exponentially with the number of sampling steps.


\subsection{Cooling computation with an idealized heat bath}\label{cooling-computation-with-moving-heat-bath}

\jinguo{
    Need to introduce the heat zone.
}
\ym{
    I tried. Please check if it is clear and if i still need to cut some details off.
}


The computational process of the TC is equivalent to finding the ground state of the TC with the spin configuration in the left surface being fixed.

We focus here on the thermodynamics-driven approach to finding ground states, 
specifically the simulated annealing (SA) method. Traditional SA method can be seen as the whole system interacting with a heat bath, by gradually decreasing the temperature
of the heat bath the TC can be driven to the ground state if the temperature is decreased slowly enough.
However, the cooling process can last for exponential time for some hard spin-glass problems.

We introduce a heat zone of width $W$, which represents the region of the system that interacts with the heat bath, as shown in \Cref{Surface-programmable-thermodynamic computer}.
Let layer $i$ be defined as the set of spins with x-coordinate $i$.
The system is devided into $\lceil\frac{M}{W}\rceil$ parts,
where part $j$ consists of layers in the range $[jW, (j+1)W-1]$.
The system can then be cooled by sequentially cooling each parts with an idealized heat bath, 
which maintains a space-invariant temperature within the heat zone while keeping other regions at zero temperature.
To drive the system toward the ground state, the cooling order should proceed from left to right
, corresponding to the computation direction of the cellular automata.

Assume the annealing procedure in each part has an error probability $\epsilon$ that prevents at least one layer
from reaching the local ground state. 
Repeating the procedure $\frac{M}{W}$ times results in a success probability of $(1 - \epsilon)^{\frac{M}{W}}$ for finding the global ground state. 
To keep this probability constant as $M \to \infty$, the error probability $\epsilon$ should scale as $\frac{W}{M}$.


Now we turn to determining the sweep time $t_{th}$ required to achieve an error probability $\epsilon$ in each part. 
Let $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ be the largest and second largest eigenvalues of the Markov transition matrix, respectively. 
The relationship between $\frac{\lambda_2}{\lambda_1}$ and $W$ can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:spectral-gap}
    1 - \frac{\lambda_2}{\lambda_1} \sim e^{-W}
\end{equation}

Consequently, a relationship exists between $t_{th}$ and $\epsilon$, which is given by:

\begin{equation}
    \left( \frac{\lambda_2}{\lambda_1} \right) ^ {t_{th}} = \epsilon \rightarrow t_{th} \sim \ln(\frac{M}{W})e^{W}
\end{equation}

And the total sweep time scale as $\frac{M}{W}\ln(\frac{M}{W})e^W$.

% However, solving the ground state from the non-deterministic direction is at least as hard as solving the circuit satisfiability problem, which is NP-complete~\cite{Moore2011}.

% In our gadget, cooling from deterministic direction is from input to
% output, non-deterministic direction is from output to input. The latter
% one must be non-deterministic because this gadget is Turing-Complete.

% The goal is to drive the the \textbf{state} to the one with lowest energy as fast as possible, while some bits set to be 1 or 0 in the \textbf{state}.

\subsection{Cooling computation with a realistic heat bath}\label{estimation-of-the-computing-time}

In practice, temperature changes cannot occur instantaneously, and the temperature distribution within the heating zone may not be uniform.
Thus, we come up with a more realistic model for the block annealing process.

Now suppose the heat bath only connects to a small rectangle region of the system, creating a temperature gradient through heat flux,
The temperature $T(x, t)$  at a position with x-coordinate  $x$  and time  $t$  can be modeled as  $T(x, t) \propto \Lambda^{-|x - L(t)|}$ , 
where $\Lambda$ is a heat flux constant and $L(t)$ denotes the center of the heat bath at time $t$.

The block annealing process then can be reconstruct as moving
the heat bath from the left surface to the right surface at speed $v$. Defining $\Delta E_{max}$ to be the
largest possible energy change when a spin is fliped.
The effective heat zone with width $W'$ should then be $[y-W', y]$, where position $y$ satisfying 
$\exp(\frac{\Delta E_{max}}{T(y)}) = 0.1$ and $y<L(t)$. Since the layers
in fronts of the effective heat zone can only be fliped with a $\epsilon$ probability if the local energy would increase. 
The effective width $W'$ then should scale as $\exp(-\Delta E_{max} \Lambda^{cW'}) \sim \epsilon \sim \frac{W'}{M}$, where $c$ is an empirical constant for effective width and can be determined during the experiment. 
\ym{I am not sure about how to give a concrete definition of the effective width $W'$.}

The total sweep time with a fixed inputs size $N$ can be calculated as 

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:total-annealing-time}
    t_{total} \propto \frac{M}{W'}(\ln(\frac{M}{W'}))^{1+ \frac{1}{c\ln(\Lambda)}}
\end{equation}

To determine the relationship between the total annealing time and the input size $N$, we should
further discuss the relationship between the spectral gap given in  \Cref{eq:spectral-gap} and inputs size $N$.
However, we failed to find a direct relationship.
Numerical result shows that computing complexity is linear to $N$. Thus a total sweep time
for the computation should scale as $NM\log^{1 + \frac{1}{c\ln(\Lambda)}}(M)$.
\ym{Please help me to think about how to evaluate the time complexity while $N$ increases.} 
The moving speed $v$ can be then calculated as

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:moving-speed}
    v \propto \frac{t_{total}}{M} = N\log^{1 + \frac{1}{c\ln(\Lambda)}}(M)
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Testing model with non-equilibrium simulated
annealing}\label{some-details-about-non-equilibrium-simulated-annealing}

The classical simulated annealing can only deal with the situation that
the temperature is space-invariant. However, we need to borden this concept
due to the temperature gradient. Although there are many ways to
simulated a real-world system with temperature gradient, such as
Molecular Dynamics \cite{Bai2015, Deng2006}, but
these methods mainly depend on dynamically adjusting the atomic
velocities to achieve a temperature gradient, which can't be directly
used in our model.

There are also Monte Carlo-based methods to simulate a moving
temperature wave packet that facilitates material growth~\cite{Godfrey1995, Tan2017}.
However, these methods fail to establish a direct connection between the simulated temperature and experimental
temperature~\cite{Zollner2014}.
Therefore, based on HeatBath acceptance rule, we made a slight modification to the classical SA model.

When we flip one spin, there would be some energy difference
$\Delta E_{i}$ in field $i$ with temperature $T_i$. The
probability to accept this flip would be

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:non-equilibrium-SA}
P = \frac{1}{1 + e^{\sum_i \frac{\Delta E_i}{T_i}}}
\end{equation}

It is easily to observe that when the system returns to
heat-equilibrium, the probability reverts to the classical HeatBath
acceptance probability. We also provided a more general proof by constructing another equivalent model in \Cref{proof-of_non-equilibrium-SA}.


\section{Numerical simulation}\label{sec:numerical-result}

Given that simulating a CA with a deep computational layer on the Ising model requires many spins, making large-scale numerical simulations impractical, we opted to introduce a similar but simpler energy model to observe the behavior on a larger scale.
Let us define a simpler but ``equivalent'' energy model on a 2D lattice of size $N \times M$, whose hamiltonian
is given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:toy-hamiltonian}
E(\vn) = \sum_{j=1}^{M-1}\sum_{i=1}^{N} (n_{i+1, j} \land \neg(n_{i, j} \land \neg n_{i-1, j})) \veebar n_{i,j+1},
\end{equation}
where $n_{i, j} \in \{0, 1\}$ is the state of the cell at row $i$ and column $j$, the lattice is periodic in the space direction, i.e. $n_{0, t} = n_{N, j}$.
%$S$ to be the length of the material along the ``Space'' axis, $D$
%to be the length of the material along the ``Time'' axis. 
%Its ground state with energy $0$ also encodes a $110$ CA, where the direction of computation is from the left to right.

\jinguo{show a comparison from right to left}
\ym{I will do this in the next version.}

Here we conducted numerical experiments to examine how the cooling time $T_{c}$ scales with (i)
the ``Space'' dimension $N$, (ii) the ``Time'' dimension $M$, (iii) the ``Width'' of the heat zone $W$, and (iv) the temperature gradient $\Lambda$.
We use the number of SA sweeps as the metric to measure the cooling time, which could be determined with the binary search.
We keep changing the heat bath moving speed $v$ (in unit of columns/sweep) until the system can reach a ground state configuration with $\sim 50\%$ probability.

\Cref{fig:main-numerical-result}(a) shows the relationship between
$\ln(\ln(M))$ and $\ln(v)$ shoule be linear, which implies 
the time complexity $T_c$ along the ``Time'' direction should scale as $M\ln(M)^{f(\Lambda)}$. 
We then fit the slopes of each line and $\frac{1}{\ln(\Lambda)}$ and find the 
empirical constant $c$ in \Cref{eq:total-annealing-time} to be $3$. \Cref{fig:main-numerical-result}(b) shows 
the the relationship between $T_c$ and $M$ should be linear. Combining these two results, 
we can conclude that the time complexity should scales as $NM\log(M)^{1+\frac{1}{3\ln(\Lambda)}}$, 
which is consistent with our theoretical prediction in \Cref{eq:total-annealing-time}.

\jinguo{I hope we can also present some results for the random fluctuation model.
We just need some quantitative result about how the computing time scales with the depth.

\section{Ising machine gadget design}\label{sec:gadget-design}
To map our toy model in \Cref{eq:toy-hamiltonian} to
spin-glass model, we used Linear Programming algorithm.
Linear problems are problems that can be express in standard form as

\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        &\min_{x \in \mathbb{R}^n} \sum_{i=1}^n c_ix_i\\
        &\text{s.t. } l_j \leq \sum_{i=1}^n a_{i,j}x_i \leq u_j, \; j=1,\ldots,m\\
        &p_i \leq x_i \leq q_i, \; i=1,\ldots, n
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

Here with a spin-glass consists $N$ atoms, we choose $n$ to be $\frac{N(N-1)}{2} + N$, which means each variable $x_i$ represents a correspond interaction energy $J_{u, v}$ or a correspond onsite energy $h_u$, we assigned aliases to these $x_i$ as $x_{u,v}$ or $x_{u}$.

Let the configuration space of the system be $S = \{\mathbf s_i\mid i=1,\ldots, 2^N\}$, each associated with an energy $H(\mathbf s_i)$. We denote the target states with minimum energy as $S_{\text{min}} \subseteq S$. We can express the linear programming problem as

\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        &\min_{J \in \mathbb{R}^{N(N{-}1)/2}, h\in \mathbb{R}^N} 0\\
        &H(\mathbf s_i) < H(\mathbf s_j), \forall \mathbf s_i \in S_{\text{min}}, \mathbf s_j \in S \setminus S_{\text{min}}\\
        &H(\mathbf s_i) = H(\mathbf s_j), \forall \mathbf s_i, \mathbf s_j \in S_{\text{min}}
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

Note that $H$ is a linear function of $J$ and $h$, so the
constraints are linear. The less constraints and equality constraints
can be easily transformed into inequality constraints by adding ancilla
variables.

We set the $S_{\text{min}}$ to be the eight degenerate ground states of the spin-glass model to implement the $110$ rule.
This is overly strict, as we do not consider the case that the ground states for different input signals to have degeneracy.
The minimum number of atoms required to satisfy the
constraints is 5. We set the target states to

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering

satisfying the constraints is

\section{Proof of the applicability of non-equilibrium SA}\label{proof-of_non-equilibrium-SA}

Assume there is another model where the temperature at the region with 
time coordinate $x$ at step $t$ is $T(x, t) = T_0\Lambda^{x - \eta t}$, where 
$\eta$ is cooling constant and $T_0$ satisfies $\exp(\frac{\Delta E_{max}}{T_0})\approx 1$, 
which means all the system stays in a relative high temperature initially. 
We called this model as temperature gradient model.

The cooling process starts at $t=0$ and ends at $t=t_{end}$, where $t_{end}$ satisfies
$\exp(\frac{\Delta E_{max}}{T_0\Lambda^{T - \eta t_{end}}}) \gg 1$, representing there wouldn't be any heat
fluctuations in the system. By noticing that we can define the effective heat zone
similarly to the moving heat bath model and then evaluating the time complexity, one can show that these two model are
equivalent.

The temperature gradient model can then be easily transform to
the energy gradient model in which equilibrilium SA can be applied by rescale local interacting and onsite energy.
The markov process can be treated with uniform temperature while rescale the energy associated with spin with Time-coordinate $x$
to be $E_{energy-gradient}(x) = E_{temp-gradient}(x)\Lambda^{-x}$. The acceptance probability is
invariant under this transformation.

\begin{equation}
    \exp\left({\frac{\Delta E_x}{T\Lambda^{x-\eta t}}}\right) = \exp\left({\frac{\Delta E_x\Lambda^{-x}}{T\Lambda^{-\eta t}}}\right) = \exp\left({\frac{\Delta E_x \Lambda^{-x}}{T(t)}}\right)
\end{equation}

We conducted numerical experiments to verify this equivalence under the condition
that $\Lambda = 1.3$ and $n=15$. The result is shown in \Cref{EGvsMHB}.

\subsection{Speed and work}\label{speed-and-work}

The trade-off between the energy consumption and the speed of
computation~\cite{Feynman2018}. To avoid confusion, we emphasize the
``energy consumption'' is defined as the work done in a computational
process, which is the same as the amount of heat dissipated to the
environment. This quantity has a lower bound given by the Landauer
principle, which states that the work done in a computation is at least
$kT\ln 2$ per bit erased\cite{Reeb2014}.

Information erasure in the surface programmable material is proportional
to the volume of the material, which is $O(tS)$, where $t$ is the
time of computation, and $S$ is memory (proportional to the surface
area) of the material.

From the chemical reaction perspective, the speed of computation is
determined by the parameter $\lambda$.

\subsubsection{Quantum adiabatic annealing energy gap}\label{quantum-adiabatic-annealing-energy-gap}

One possible way is to use quantum adiabatic annealing: start from a
simple hamiltonian $H(0)$ and its simple ground state
$|\psi(0)\rangle$, then gradually change the parameters until reaching
the desire hamiltonian $H(t)$.

More specifically, set $\Delta(t=0) <0$ and $\Omega(t=0) =0$
initially, then first turning on $\Omega(t)$ to a non-zero value,
sweeping $\Delta(t)$ to final value, and finally turning off
$\Omega(t)$.

\begin{equation}
H_{QAA}(t) = \sum_{v\in V} (-\Delta(t)w_v \hat n_v + \Omega(t)\sigma_{v}^x) + \sum_{(u,w) \in E} U\hat n_u \hat n_w
\end{equation}

If the time evolution is sufficiently slow, then by the adiabatic
theorem, the system follows the instantaneous ground state, ending up in
the solution to the MWIS problem~\cite{Pichler2018}.
Then we only need to evalute
the minimum energy gap $\Delta_{QAA}$ between the ground and
first-excited states of instantaneous hamiltonian.

We set $\Omega = 1 \times 2\pi$ and sweep the $\Delta$ from $3
\times 2\pi$ to $40 \times 2\pi$ with 1*1 gadget. For deterministic
direction, we simply set the weight of the input vertices to $50$; as
for non-deterministic direction, we set the weight of the output vertice
to $50$.

Result listed as follows. \textbf{However, we didn't see cooling from
deterministic direction would give a smaller energy gap than the other
direction. We think that's because the size of this gadget is too
small.}

\section{Classical Dynamics}\label{classical-dynamics-1}
We firstly tried classical adiabatic annealing with the classical-spin
mapping method~\cite{Wang2013}
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \vec M_i}{\partial t} = \vec M_{i} \times \vec H_{i}(t)
\end{equation}

where

\begin{equation}
\vec H_i(t) = -\frac{\partial H(t)}{\partial \vec M_i} 
\end{equation}

Here the hamiltonian of the system is

\begin{equation}
H(t) = \frac{t}{T}(\sum_{u,v}J_{u,v} M_{u,z}M_{v,z} + \sum_{u} h_u M_{u, z}) + (1-\frac{t}{T})(I\sum_{u}M_{u,x})
\end{equation}

The former term is the generally increasing target hamiltonian, the
latter term is a generally decreasing known Ising-transverse field. We
can explicitly write out the effective magnetic field.

\[
\vec H_{i}(t) = -\frac{t}{T}(\sum_{v}J_{i, v}M_{v,z} + h_i)\hat e_z - (1-\frac{t}{T})I\hat e_x
\]

Integrate the ordinary differential equation then we get the classical
dynamics of this spin-glass model. However, result shows that it is
extremely hard to find the solution when the number of layers exceed
$4$ (input layer is pinned).

The reason maybe that the mapped spin-glass model lies in the hard
region in ~\cite{Wang2013}. Because every interaction energy is positive, which
gives rise to strong frustration. Results in this reference also shows that even in
random spin-glass model, there exist hard instance that can't be solve.
